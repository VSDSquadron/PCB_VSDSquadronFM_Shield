## 5. PCB Layout
The PCB layout ensures optimal routing and signal integrity while accommodating all components.

**Summary of Layer Synergy:**
The **F.Cu layer** is used for signal routing and active components, while the **B.Cu layer** supports grounding, power distribution, and auxiliary signal routing.
Both layers are designed to complement each other, ensuring efficient signal flow, reduced noise, and optimized manufacturing processes.
This dual-layer strategy results in a highly functional, durable, and reliable PCB for the mechanical keyboard.

Key Features:
* Carefully routed traces for LED control.
* Footprints for standard MX-style mechanical switches.
* Compact design with minimal interference.

## 6. ERC and DRC Checks

- DRC (Design Rule Check): Passed for trace clearances, via sizes, and other manufacturing constraints.

## 7. 3D Viewer
- The 3D viewer in KiCad provides a realistic preview of the PCB, showing component placement and board dimensions.
- Use the 3D Viewer feature in KiCad to visualize your design before manufacturing.

## 8. Bill of Materials (BOM)
A detailed BOM is included, listing all components:

- Mechanical Switches: Compatible with MX-style switches.
